lcamtuf put together an [excellent primer](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/radios-how-do-they-work) on how radios work. Their goal was to "provide an introduction to radio thatâ€™s free of ham jargon and advanced math" and I think they succeeded. It's well worth a review, even if you're an experienced ham.

[The video below](https://vimeo.com/926457795/02bd144b5c?share=copy) is one of the excellent demos in the article:
