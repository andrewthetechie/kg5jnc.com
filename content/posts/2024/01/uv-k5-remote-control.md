The Quansheng UV-K5 and its variants have gained a lot of popularity today, often being called the "Baofeng killer". These low cost HTs are not that impressive out of the box (8w, basic features, same issues as cheap SDR radios like the Baofengs) but intrepid hackers are creating modified firmwares for the radio that improve its feature set. Some of these new features include monitoring (and transmitting, but don't!) outside of VHF/UHF bands, basic SSB support, onscreen spectrum analyzers, and now remote control.

[Nicsure](https://github.com/nicsure) has released [a firmware](opymethat.com) and [dock app](https://github.com/nicsure/QuanshengDock) (Windows only) that allows you to control the radio using its programming cable from your PC. With some hardware mods you can build a cable that allows you to connect your programming cable, a handmic, and your PC's audio to the radio.

[TechMinds](https://www.youtube.com/@TechMindsOfficial) on youtube has a video overview on this new firmware and app and [ModernHam](https://www.youtube.com/@ModernHam) has a bit more detail on how to install the firmware
