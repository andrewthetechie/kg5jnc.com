[Hackaday shared a video](https://hackaday.com/2024/01/13/how-to-operate-a-500kw-transmitter/) from the National VOA Museum of Broadcasting about the history of the 500kW WLW AM broadcast transmitter. WLW was sometimes called "the nation's channel" because it was so powerful you could hear it in most of the United States.

The tubes in this transmitter are amazing!
