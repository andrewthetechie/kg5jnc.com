![Meshtastic Solar Light](/images/2024/01/harbor-breeze-meshtastic.png)

Tavis [shared his work](https://hackaday.io/project/194509-harbor-breeze-meshtastic-hack) to use a low-cost solar light as a waterproof enclosure with [RAK baseboards](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-meshtastic-starter-kit).

<!--more-->

The light used is a [$15 Harbor Breeze model](https://www.lowes.com/pd/60LM-Solar-Spot-Light/1002689960) available from Lowe's, but I've seen quite a few lights that match the same design for sale at other retailers. The light provides a working solar panel, lithium-ion battery, a charge controller, and a waterproof-ish enclosure.

I appreciate re-using a common lawn item to disguise a wireless node. I might build a set of these and ask my neighbors to let me deploy them in their yards to create a neighborhood wide Meshtastic network.
