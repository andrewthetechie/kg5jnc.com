The [Tech Minds youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TechMindsOfficial) released a video on low-power, low-cost APRS trackers using Lilygo TWR Plus ESP32 devices.

This is made possible by an [open-source firmware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJTNMjpJB98) released by [nakhonthai (HS5TQA)](https://github.com/nakhonthai). From the firmware's README:

> ESP32APRS(T-TWR Plus) works in 3-modes: APRS internet gateway, digital repeater, tracker, with built-in TNC and radio transceiver. which is used with the ESP32-S3 LILYGO T-TWR Plus V2.0 board.

The included screen and jogwheel provide on-device configuration and there is a web interface you can use from your phone/computer.

I'm intrigued by this project and have added the parts to my "future projects" list to buy and try out. This could be a low-power replacement for my Raspberry Pi and Direwolf based portable digipeater/igate for APRS.
