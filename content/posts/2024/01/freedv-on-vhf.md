[FreeDV](https://freedv.org/) is an open source amateur digital voice mode, primarily for HF radio. It is being developed by a team of amatuer radio operators. The modems and the voice codec (Codec 2) are both open source.

I'm a big fan of open source software and hardware. FreeDV has been on my list of things to learn more about, but since I do not do any HF right now, its been backburnered.

ModernHam released a video of using FreeDV on VHF with a Baofeng UV-5R, a computer, and an audio interface. Time to break out my Digirig and some Baofengs and give FreeDV a try.
